                <p class="slp">EasyMining is the ‘original’ concept of mining. You validate blocks of cryptocurrency transactions with your own computing power and get a reward for your ‘work’. But mining has evolved so much that now very large ‘pools’ (groups of computing power) make it much harder for an easy miner to find a block on their own, since you are competing against much larger operations, and they split the rewards among all their miners</p>

                <p>Bitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency, a virtual currency designed to act as money and a form of payment outside the control of any one person, group, or entity, thus removing the need for third-party involvement in financial transactions. It is rewarded to blockchain miners for the work done to verify transactions and can be purchased on several exchanges.

                    Bitcoin was introduced to the public in 2009 by an anonymous developer or group of developers using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.

                    It has since become the most well-known cryptocurrency in the world. Its popularity has inspired the development of many other cryptocurrencies. These competitors either attempt to replace it as a payment system or are used as utility or security tokens in other blockchains and emerging financial technologies.</p>

The following headings are some of the important topics, which we handled in this guide, and we believe sharing them here will provide you a better navigation in the guide.</p>

                <h1>When Is the Best Time to Buy Bitcoins?</h1>
                <p>One of the common questions wondered by new investors is how they <mark> “can know the best time to buy Bitcoin”</mark>

                    Just like in all investment tools, the answer to this question is not simple. Many factors can easily affect the answer such as your purpose for buying Bitcoin.
                    
                    For instance, in case you are willing to trade Bitcoins and make a profit from buying and/or selling at low and high prices, there is no right or wrong time to do so. What matters is your experience and knowledge about the industry. Moreover, you need to know more about different techniques to be used in trading.
                    
                    If you are not interested in short-term investments and looking for more rewarding and long-term investments, then you are interested in Bitcoin technology. In this regard, there are two different concepts that you need to know.</p>
                    <h1>Buying Bitcoins Regardless of The Price</h1>
                    <p>This is the most common concept, which long-term investors believe. Basically, this approach supports the idea of Bitcoin prices will go up in the long term. Therefore, there is no right or wrong time to make the buying decision</p>
                    <h1>Buying Bitcoins According to Their Dollar Cost Averaging Price</h1>
                    <p>The Dollar Cost Averaging concept, which is also known as DCA, relies on the fluctuations in the exchange rates between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. You basically focus on buying Bitcoins in exchange for a certain balance of a fiat currency.

                        Depending on your investing strategy and your patience, you can pick any of the above-mentioned concepts and adapt them. However, in general, DCA is recommended for new investors since it is a medium-term investment concept that can be cut short when needed.</p>
                        <h1>Which Platforms Should You Prefer to Buy Bitcoins?</h1>
                        <p>Probably, this is the most challenging task for those who wonder how to buy Bitcoin in <?=date('Y')?>. However, choosing the right Bitcoin exchange platform can easily affect the course of your investments. There are many things to consider while finding the best platform for yourself.

                            This is why we have gathered all these factors in the following. Things you may want to consider can include;</p>
                            <p><h4 class="h41">The Reputation of the Exchange Platform</h4>After all, you are going to deposit your real money to the platform you are going to prefer. Therefore, you may want to prefer reputable platforms. You can check the overall experiences of their former users on the internet. It is recommended to avoid exchange platforms with plenty of complaints against them.</p>
                            <p><h4 class="h41">buying limits</h4> If you are going to invest small, then you will not have to worry about this one. On the other hand, if you are going to start big or plan to increase your investments in the future, then buying limit is one of the factors to consider. In general, this information is shared in the FAQs section of the platforms.</p>
                            <p><h4 class="h41">exchange rates</h4>Due to arbitrage, different couple of exchanges have different rates. In general, you will want to pay less rate for each exchange. Otherwise, you will need to give up on your profit or maximize your losses.</p>
                            <p><h4 class="h41">fees</h4> Each platform has different principles in terms of charging fees. In general, you will be charged for Bitcoin network fees, deposit fees, withdrawal fees, and transaction fees. It is advisable to check out all these fees before choosing the right platform for yourself</p>
                            <p><h4 class="h41">payment methods</h4> Please note that there are no obligations about every exchange platform that will offer every payment option to you. Therefore, make sure that you pick the one that offers your preferred payment options.</p>
                            <p><h4 class="h41">supported countries</h4> Just like the payment methods, not all exchange platforms offer their services worldwide. Make sure that you pick the one that offers services in your country.</p>
                            <h1>Bitcoin Exchange Types You Need to Know (payment methods)</h1>
                            <p>Another important topic that you need to consider while choosing the right exchange platform for yourself is the type of exchange you are planning to focus on. There are three types that you can prefer, and different exchange platforms focus on different types of exchanges.</p>
                            <h1>P2P Platforms (Peer-to-Peer)</h1>
                            <p>You can think of these platforms as free markets. Buyers and sellers can contact each other without any limitation and negotiate on the prices. The biggest downside of this exchange type is the lack of trust between the traders. Eventually, you are nothing but strangers to each other.On the other hand, these platforms serve in many countries and offer more payment options. Some of the popular P2P exchange platforms include <span><a href="">localbitcoin</a></span> and <span><a href="">paxful</a></span> .</p>
                            <h1>Brocker Platforms</h1>
                            <p>As the name suggests, these platforms serve as a broker while you are trading. This means that they set the prices and you carry out your trades over these prices. Different platforms offer different pricing for each coin.

                                It will be worth noting that anyone thinking about how to buy Bitcoin in <?=date('Y')?> should start with these platforms. These platforms have a simple user interface and are relatively easier to get the concept. Therefore, they are the most popular one among the three options. Some popular broker platforms include Coinbase and Coinmama.</p>
                                
                                <p>Bitcoin trading platforms can be considered as a combination of P2P and broker platforms. Prices are determined by individual sellers just like you, but you do not have direct communication with them. These platforms charge a small fee for each transaction in exchange for their services.

                                    These platforms are also the cheapest option to buy Bitcoin in <?=date('Y')?>. Some of them even offer services such as limit orders and stop losses. They are the best options for those who are planning to engage in short-term investments.
                                    
                                    Some of the popular Bitcoin trading platforms include Bitstamp, Kraken, and BitMex.</p>

                                   
                                    <h1>Which Bitcoin Wallet Should You Prefer?</h1>
                                    <p>Since you know where and how to buy Bitcoin in <?=date('Y')?>, it is time to learn how to keep them safe. Bitcoin wallets are not that much different than our traditional wallets which we keep in our pockets. The only difference is they can be a hardware or digital service.

                                        Any Bitcoin you are going to buy through exchange platforms should be transferred to your own Bitcoin wallet. In this way, none one but you can access your assets without your permission. This offers full control over your investments.
                                        
                                        Of course, you can keep your Bitcoins on the platform for future trades. However, this method bears a risk. Anyone who will hack the systems of the exchange platform can easily steal all your investment. Moreover, unexpected shutdown of the system may also lead to huge losses. Although this one is rare, it can still happen and there are examples of this in history.
                                        
                                        The good news is there are many popular Bitcoin wallet alternatives you can prefer. It may be quite challenging to make a comparison between them but here are some of the popular alternatives you can consider:</p>
                                        <ol class="ol1">

                                        <h1>What Are Private Keys and Bitcoin Addresses?</h1>
                                        <p>There are two main elements that help your wallets to keep your assets safe and these are private keys and Bitcoin addresses. It is important to understand these as a part of the answer to how to buy Bitcoin in <?=date('Y')?>.</p>
                                        <p><h4 class="h41">bitcoin address</h4> You can think of these addresses as your phone number or email. You need to provide this information so that people can send Bitcoins to you. It is a set of random letters and numbers, which usually start with 1 or 3. You do not need to keep it a secret and can share it publicly.An example to Bitcoin Address is <mark>1BvDMSEYstWeqtTFn5Aum44GFg7xJaVNN2</mark>.</p>
                                        <p><h4 class="h41">private key</h4>  You can think of this as the pin code of your sim card or password of your email account. This information must be kept private since anyone who knows it can access your wallet. It is not recommended to keep this information on devices with an internet connection.</p>
                                        <h1>How Much Should You Invest in Bitcoins?</h1>
                                        <p>Besides how to buy Bitcoin in <?=date('Y')?>, you need to ask yourself how much you are planning to invest in too. This will determine the future of your trades as well as your investment strategy.

                                            Just like in all investment tools, Bitcoin also bears high risks and high rewards. We recommend not investing huge amounts that can change the course of your lives in case you lose them in the worst scenario. Moreover, since you are a beginner, starting small will always be a good idea until you fully understand how the market works.
                                            
                                            In this respect, you can receive assistance from your friends who are experienced in the finance industry. They can guide you about the basics of investments. Although Bitcoin is a digital currency, it is still a currency and part of a real economy.</p>

                                           <p>Like with any new technology, the attempts at regulating Bitcoin have been difficult. The current Biden administration seeks to impose regulations around Bitcoin, but at the same time walks a tightrope in trying not to throttle a growing and economically beneficial industry.
                                            14
                                            
                                            Biden has stated he will seek to prevent the illegal use of Bitcoin but also support its development. The U.S. has particularly been focused on regulating crypto and its criminal usage overseas, such as sanctioning cryptocurrency exchanges and individual cryptocurrency wallets and recovering crypto payments made to criminals. There have also been calls for the U.S. to develop a central bank digital currency (CBDC) to appropriately direct these sanctions.
